# Notes
I tried to follow the instructions for this project exactly. I realize its not quite perfect but I had limited time this week to work on it.

I created this project in angular, and I used the built in Jasmine and Karma testing framework included to create some tests for the data filtering and sorting.

To run this project you will need NodeJs installed on your machine. 
Please download and open the command line to the project directoy on your computer. 
Run the following commands.
$ npm install - to Install npm packages.
$ npm start - to start the angular server. 
Note- you can also use "ng serve" if you want.
It should show that the server is started on port 4200. 
Open localhost:4200 to see the results.

In order to test run
$ ng test
This will open a seperate window that will display the results of the jasmine tests.
The tests are written in the Bookshelf\src\app\bookshelf\bookshelf.component.spec.ts file.
